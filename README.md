The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
