IMG_2803 2.JPG,
IMG_2142.JPG,
IMG_2312.JPG,

Image source is "images/work". Page title is "Darin Murray"

Include a logo (images/work/darinmurray_logos_large_dark.png) at the top center, overlaying all images and does not scroll.

Make the logo fade out as the user scrolls more than 100px down and fade back in as the user scrolls to the top of the page.
--- DESCRIPTIONS ---

Include a description on top of each image with white font color and a 3em font size and no background

Each description sticks to to the bottom left of each image with a max 5% margin and 5px padding.

the descriptions scale with the viewport
Put one sentance in each paragraph, using the 5 lines below, in order
I’m Darin Murray, and I’m glad you’re here.
I was born to create. I’m an artist.
I can do anything.
The pandemic brought me down.
It’s time to come back up, anew. Rebuild.
Present and forward.

Use CSS so that each image height equals the viewport height and scales proportionately from the center

Use images/work/darinmurray_logos_large_dark.png for light colored backgrounds

Use images/work/darinmurray_logos_large_light.png for dark colored backgrounds

use the images/work/darinmurray_logos_large_dark.png logo when the page is scrolled all the way to the top.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.

more images, once final
